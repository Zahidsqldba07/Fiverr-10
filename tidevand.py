    # Some days have 4 predictions, others have only 3. Why is that?
    # Take for example the 5th of January 2022:
    #202201050552	  -19
    #202201051153	   20
    #202201051811	  -24

    # The 'value' of each prediction is the expected *lowest* or *highest* water level within an ebb and flow cycle.
